- Useful for when the list is ALMOST sorted
- Perform really well in small datasets
- We start with second element of the array as first element in the array  assumed to be sorted.
- Compare second element with the first element and check if the second element is smaller then swap them.
- Move to the third element and compare it with the first two elements and put at its correct position
- Repeat until the entire array is sorted.
