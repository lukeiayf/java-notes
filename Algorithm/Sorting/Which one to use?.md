- If your data is small or almost sorted -> Insertion Sort
- Educational purposes only -> Bubble Sort, Selection Sort
- Worried about worst case scenarios -> Merge Sort
- External sorting in an external process -> Merge Sort
- If you are not worried about worst case -> Quick Sort
- Overall Quick Sort sees the most implementation, but be aware of the worst case scenario
