- O(n log n) Time Complexity
- If the pivot was the first or last key in the sort it becomes O(nÂ²) at worst case
- O(n log n) Space Complexity
- It works by determining a pivot in the list and comparing all that its lesser and bigger to it to create lists
- All lesser go the left
- All bigger go to the right
- After that divide using the pivot
- Do the same with the divided lists until they are all sorted
- Merge all lists
- VERY USEFUL AND FAST
