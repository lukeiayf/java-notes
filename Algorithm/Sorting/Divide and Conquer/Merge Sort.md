- O(n log n) Space Complexity
- O(n) Time Complexity
- Very fast and efficient for lists and arrays
- Uses divide and conquer approach
- Uses recursion
- Its a stable algorithm(It mantains order of duplicates)
- t works by recursively dividing the input array into smaller subarrays and sorting those subarrays then merging them back together to obtain the sorted array.
