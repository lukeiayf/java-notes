- It is an optimization technique that makes use of cache
- If you have something you can cache you can use Dynamic Programming
- Breaks down big problems into small problems, solve them and keep them cached if you need to use the solution somewhere else

Dynamic Programming Flow
- Can the main problem be divided into sub-problems?
	- Use recursive solution
- Are there repetitive subproblems?
	- Memoize subproblems
