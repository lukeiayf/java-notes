- More complex algorithms
- Specifically used to find shortest path
- DFS and BFS does not account for the weights of a graph
- Useful for weighted graphs

- Bellman-Ford works with negative weights on a graph, but it's not the most efficient with a O(nÂ²)
- Dijkstra is more efficient but cannot work with negative weights
