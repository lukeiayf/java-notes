### How Lazy Loading Works

When lazy loading is implemented, Vue splits the application into smaller chunks (typically by components or routes). These chunks are loaded asynchronously when the user interacts with a part of the app that requires them. This defers the loading of components until they are actually required, rather than downloading the entire app at once.

### Lazy Loading in Vue Components

Vue allows components to be lazy-loaded using dynamic `import()` syntax. Instead of importing a component synchronously, you load it when the user navigates to the view or when the component is needed in the UI.

```
// Synchronous loading
import MyComponent from './components/MyComponent.vue';

// Lazy loading using dynamic import
const MyComponent = () => import('./components/MyComponent.vue');

```

### Lazy Loading in Vue Router

Vue Router supports lazy loading for routes, meaning you can load route components only when the route is visited.

```
const routes = [
  {
    path: '/about',
    component: () => import('@/views/About.vue') // Lazy loading route component
  },
  {
    path: '/contact',
    component: () => import('@/views/Contact.vue')
  }
];

```
