- HashTables,HashMaps, etc...
- **They are unordered**
- HashMaps use hashes to indicate an index of an value
- It hashes values using hash functions
- Hashes are one way and constant
- Key value pair
- Really fast data access;

**Big O**

- Insert -> O(1)
- Lookup -> O(1)
- Delete -> O(1)
- Search -> O(1)

**Hash Collisions**

- When one or more values is assigned to the same hash key
- To access an item in a collision is O(n/2)
