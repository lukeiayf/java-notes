- Graphs are based on real life structures
- Graphs also have nodes and edges just
- Most data structures are actually types of graphs
- An example of a graph is a relationship structure or a destination itinerary

**Directed and Undirected graphs**

- Directed graphs have a directed relationship between nodes
- Undirected are free, think facebook friends

**Weighted and Unweighted graphs**

- I this way each node or edge can have a weight associated with it

**Cyclic and Acyclic**

-  If you can go from one node to another and then find your way back to the start it is a cyclic node
